## Development Setup

### Getting the source code

The easiest way to do this is to check out the Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/engineersftw/website.git
```

The git repository will be checked out into a local folder named `website`.

***(If you are keen on contributing to this project, do [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and check out from your own fork of the Git repository.)***

### Install Ruby

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

2. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

	```
brew update
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

3. Add `rbenv` support to your local profile:

	```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

	If you are using `zsh`:

	```
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Install the current Ruby version:

	```
rbenv install -l
rbenv install 2.3.0
```

4. Use it globally:

	```
rbenv global 2.3.0
```

### Install PostgreSQL

1. You will need [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) installed and started.

	> For newbies, I'd suggest that you download and install [Postgres Mac App](http://postgresapp.com). You may need to edit `config/database.yml` to [connect via TCP socket](http://postgresapp.com/documentation/configuration-ruby.html).

### Install Node.js

1. Node.js is required for some of the Ruby gems. (There are [alternatives](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs).)

	Install Node.js:

	```
brew install node
```

### Install Rails

1. Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

	```
gem install bundler
```

2. Install the rest of the Ruby Gems needed for the app (including Ruby on Rails):

	```
bundle install
```

### Prepare the Database


1. Create the database:

	```
bundle exec rake db:create
```

2. Create the database tables:

	```
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

3. Prepare sample data:

	```
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d website_development db/snapshot.dump
```

### Start the development web server

1. Prepare the environment file (one time exercise):

  ```
cp env.sample .env
```

2. You can start the local development web server with the following command:

	```
foreman start
```

3. You can now visit the local development site at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. The Admin panel is accessible at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). The admin login email is `admin@engineers.sg` and the default password is `password1234`.

5. To stop the dev server, just press `ctrl` + `c` on your keyboard to stop the foreman process.
